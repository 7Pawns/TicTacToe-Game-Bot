# TicTacToe-Game-Bot
## Game
Everyone knows how to play TicTacToe :)
## Modes
* Player vs Player
* Player vs Computer - The computer will never lose, it will either win or draw. Starting side is random.
* History - Database of previous games
## Premise
The bot follows an algorithm which allows it to act in every possible position in the game.   
Because TicTacToe is a simple game, we can assure the bot will never lose by using a set of predefined rules.
### Some Examples
The bot will always start in a corner, and if the player doesn't take the enter it will immediatly win the game in the following moves. 
The bot can detect traps such as starting with an edge, and will act accordingly.
